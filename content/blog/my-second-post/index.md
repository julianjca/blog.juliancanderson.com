# How To Build Habits

Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash

At the beginning of the year, we usually write down a lot of resolutions or habits that we want to develop or get rid of. We try our best to achieve everything each and every day.

We try to go to the gym.

We try to lose weight.

We try to eat healthier.

We try to write every single day.

We try to read books.

and many more.

But, sometimes we only do those habits for only a couple of months or even worse, a couple of weeks. We lose the motivation to do those habits and keep on track of what we write at the beginning of the year.

What ever you want to be in the future, building good habits can really help you to reach your goals. And the same with breaking bad habits.

Habits can make or break you.

This year I have a lot of habits to develop. I wrote it on my notes so that I can remember every thing for the rest of the year.

Last year as I wrote on my latest article, I failed to build habits and in the end I failed to reach my goals.

This year I want something different that is why I invest on a book called Atomic Habits by James Clear.

## Some things that I have learned from Atomic Habits

### 1. Change Your Identity

When we set goals we usually don’t try to change our identity. We set goals like :

I want to lose weight.

I want to read books.

The fact is in this book James states that our behavior is the outcome of our identity. We usually use those identity that people put on us or maybe you that put those identity on you. Those identity sometimes stop us from creating good habits or breaking bad habits.

Changing identity takes time. It does not happen overnight. James says that the first thing to do to change our identity is to change what we do. 2 simple steps are deciding the person we want to be and prove it by small wins.

Every page that you read, you are a reader.

Every work out that you do, you are an athlete.

Every article you write, you are a writer.

When your identity change we will act according to our identity. When you have an identity as an athlete, you won’t miss a work out, you won’t eat mindlessly, and many more.

### 2. Stack your new habits

I have read books on habit change but this one is new for me. When you develop new habits, you can try to stack it on your recent habits. It will be easier to develop those new habits because you will remember what comes next after your current habits. For example:

After I wake up I will make my bed.

After I make my bed I will meditate for 5 minutes.

After I meditate I will take a shower.

After I take a shower I will read a book for 25 minutes.

Of course we all will wake up every single day. This is a current habit that is unbreakable. We can stack a new habit “make my bed” after waking up.

I have tried this method for around 2 weeks and it works really great for me. I can easily build habits by stacking it to my previous habits.

### 3. Make it easy

The next thing I implement when I build my habits is make the habits easy. My goal this year is to hit the gym 3 times per week. The thing that I do is to pack everything the night before. Put my protein shake on the table so it reminds me to go to the gym. I wear my gym shirt on my sleep.

These things will reduce the friction on developing habits.

Whatever habits you want to develop, you can make it easy.

If you want to read more, put the book you want to read on the table or on any surface that is easy to reach and see.

If you want to eat healthier, do meal prep every Sunday for the week.

If you want to wake up earlier, sleep earlier too.

### 4. Reward yourself

Human loves reward.

When you build your habits you can’t see the reward immediately. That is why we tend to stop in the middle of the journey of building our habits.

If you go to the gym, you won’t see the result immediately. But when you constantly go to the gym in a couple of months, the result will show up. Even a tiny result can be satisfying.

One of the way to reward ourself is set a loyalty system for yourself. It can be anything.

For example, if you go to the gym transfer some money to your saving account.

This immediate reward can improve your motivation to build those habits because it is satisfying to receive some rewards.

### 5. Track your habits

This one is also important for me because when you write the habits you want to build you will remember them. Human tends to forget things, that is why sometimes we forget which habits we want to develop. Habit tracking can be a fun thing to do too.

There are a lot of habit tracking apps that are fun. One of them is Habitica. You can gamify your habit building by playing RPG game. But for me the one that is easy to use and simple is Habitify on iOS. It is satisfying to make a streak on a certain habits and it made me stick to them.

There are still a lot of things that I have learned from the book. I can’t put everything on this article. But for me this is one of the best book that I have ever read. It changed my life in a lot of ways and I am ready to crush 2019!
